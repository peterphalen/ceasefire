# ceasefire

[Baltimore Ceasefire 365](https://baltimoreceasefire.com/) is a city-wide call asking Baltimore residents to avoid having any murders through quarterly Ceasefires and Peace Challenges (February, May, August, and November). 

This repository uses [open data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov) and [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) to model the impact of the ceasefire on shootings. You can see the whole thing [here](http://peterphalen.com/ceasefire/).
